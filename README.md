# Matrix-Calculator

All of the main matrix aperations have been implemented.
Along with them, there are plenty of operations for vectors and polynomials.

A really basic __Makefile__ had been provided in order to help you with the compilation and deletion of executables, as well as memory check.

# Check the example.cpp file
It will help you understand the way this API is intended to be used.

Anynone intrested is welcome to join me in developing this project further.
