# Matrix-Calculator

# The essense of this project is the header file.
Which is intented to be used as an include file in programms that need the use of Matrices.

The __.cpp__ file is simply a demonstration of the capabilities of the header file.

All of the main matrix calculation have been implemented.

A really basic __Makefile__ had been provided in order to help you with the compilation and deletion of the executable files, as well as memory check.

Anynone intrested is welcome to join me in developing this project further.

__New feature !!!__
